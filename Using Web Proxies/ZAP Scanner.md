ZAP also comes bundled with a Web Scanner similar to Burp Scanner. ZAP Scanner is capable of building site maps using ZAP Spider and performing both passive and active scans to look for various types of vulnerabilities.

---

## Spider

Let's start with `ZAP Spider`, which is similar to the Crawler feature in Burp. To start a Spider scan on any website, we can locate a request from our History tab and select (`Attack>Spider`) from the right-click menu. Another option is to use the HUD in the pre-configured browser. Once we visit the page or website we want to start our Spider scan on, we can click on the second button on the right pane (`Spider Start`), which would prompt us to start the scan:

![HTB Academy Customer Support page with contact info: http://academy.htb/customer-support.php and support@academy.htb.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/110/zap_spider.jpg)

Note: When we click on the Spider button, ZAP may tell us that the current website is not in our scope, and will ask us to automatically add it to the scope before starting the scan, to which we can say 'Yes'. The Scope is the set of URLs ZAP will test if we start a generic scan, and it can be customized by us to scan multiple websites and URLs. Try to add multiple targets to the scope to see how the scan would run differently.

Note: In some versions of browsers, the ZAP's HUD might not work as intended.

Once we click on `Start` on the pop-up window, our Spider scan should start spidering the website by looking for links and validating them, very similar to how Burp Crawler works. We can see the progress of the spider scan both in the HUD on the `Spider` button or in the main ZAP UI, which should automatically switch to the current Spider tab to show the progress and sent requests. When our scan is complete, we can check the Sites tab on the main ZAP UI, or we can click on the first button on the right pane (`Sites Tree`), which should show us an expandable tree-list view of all identified websites and their sub-directories: ![Sites Tree showing URLs and files: http://46.101.23.188:30873, devtools, index.php, robots.txt, sitemap.xml, wp-comments-post.php.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/110/zap_sites.jpg)

Tip: ZAP also has a different type of Spider called `Ajax Spider`, which can be started from the third button on the right pane. The difference between this and the normal scanner is that Ajax Spider also tries to identify links requested through JavaScript AJAX requests, which may be running on the page even after it loads. Try running it after the normal Spider finishes its scan, as this may give a better output and add a few links the normal Spider may have missed, though it may take a little bit longer to finish.

## Passive Scanner

As ZAP Spider runs and makes requests to various end-points, it is automatically running its passive scanner on each response to see if it can identify potential issues from the source code, like missing security headers or DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities. This is why even before running the Active Scanner, we may see the alerts button start to get populated with a few identified issues. The alerts on the left pane shows us issues identified in the current page we are visiting, while the right pane shows us the overall alerts on this web application, which includes alerts found on other pages:

![HTB Academy Customer Support page with contact info: http://academy.htb/customer-support.php, support@academy.htb. Page alerts: Medium.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/110/zap_alerts.jpg)

We can also check the `Alerts` tab on the main ZAP UI to see all identified issues. If we click on any alert, ZAP will show us its details and the pages it was found on:

![Site Alerts: Medium. X-Frame-Options Header Not Set for multiple URLs including http://46.101.23.188:30873/ and related paths.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/110/zap_site_alerts.jpg)

---

## Active Scanner

Once our site's tree is populated, we can click on the `Active Scan` button on the right pane to start an active scan on all identified pages. If we have not yet run a Spider Scan on the web application, ZAP will automatically run it to build a site tree as a scan target. Once the Active Scan starts, we can see its progress similarly to how we did with the Spider Scan:

![HTB Academy Customer Support page with contact info: http://academy.htb/customer-support.php, support@academy.htb. Active Scan at 4%.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/110/zap_active_scan.jpg)

The Active Scanner will try various types of attacks against all identified pages and HTTP parameters to identify as many vulnerabilities as it can. This is why the Active Scanner will take longer to complete. As the Active Scan runs, we will see the alerts button start to get populated with more alerts as ZAP uncovers more issues. Furthermore, we can check the main ZAP UI for more details on the running scan and can view the various requests sent by ZAP:

![Active scan at 42% on http://46.101.23.188:30873, showing request details including method, URL, status code, and response time.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/110/zap_active_scan_progress.jpg)

Once the Active Scan finishes, we can view the alerts to see which ones to follow up on. While all alerts should be reported and taken into consideration, the `High` alerts are the ones that usually lead to directly compromising the web application or the back-end server. If we click on the `High Alerts` button, it will show us the identified High Alert: ![Site Alerts: High. Remote OS Command Injection detected.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/110/zap_high_alert.jpg)

We can also click on it to see more details about it and see how we may replicate and patch this vulnerability:

![Remote OS Command Injection alert. High risk, medium confidence. Attack example: 127.0.0.1&cat /etc/passwd&. Evidence: root:x:0:0.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/110/zap_alert_details.jpg)

In the alert details window, we can also click on the URL to see the request and response details that ZAP used to identify this vulnerability, and we may also repeat the request through ZAP HUD or ZAP Request Editor:

![HTTP Message showing user account details from /etc/passwd. Options: Active Scan, Replay in Console, Replay in Browser.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/110/zap_alert_evidence.jpg)

---

## Reporting

Finally, we can generate a report with all of the findings identified by ZAP through its various scans. To do so, we can select (`Report>Generate HTML Report`) from the top bar, which would prompt us for the save location to save the report. We may also export the report in other formats like `XML` or `Markdown`. Once we generate our report, we can open it in any browser to view it:

![Summary of Alerts: 1 High, 3 Medium, 8 Low, 6 Informational. Alerts include Remote OS Command Injection, Cross-Domain Misconfiguration, Directory Browsing, and others.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/110/zap_report.jpg)

As we can see, the report shows all identified details in an organized manner, which may be helpful to keep as a log for various web applications we run our scans on during a penetration test.

## Question 1

### "Run ZAP Scanner on the exercise above to identify directories and potential vulnerabilities. Once you find the high-level vulnerability, try to use it to read the flag at '/flag.txt'"

After spawning the target machine, students need to run `ZAP`, make sure that `FoxyProxy` is set to the preconfigured option "Burp (8080)" in `Firefox`, and capture a request to the machine's website root page by navigating to it:

![Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_30.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/walkthroughs/56/Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_30.png)

Then, students need to right-click on the request and select `Attack` -> `Spider`:

![Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_31.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/walkthroughs/56/Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_31.png)

Students can keep the default configurations as is and click on `Start Scan`:

![Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_32.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/walkthroughs/56/Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_32.png)

Once the scan has finished, students need to click on the website's folder and click on `Attack` -> `Active Scan`:

![Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_33.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/walkthroughs/56/Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_33.png)

Students can keep the default configurations as is and click on `Start Scan`:

![Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_34.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/walkthroughs/56/Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_34.png)

Students need not to wait until the scan finishes completely, instead, once they see 1 for the `High Priority Alerts` flag, they need to click on `Alerts`:

![Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_35.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/walkthroughs/56/Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_35.png)

Subsequently, students will find that the vulnerability is a `Remote OS Command Injection`:

![Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_36.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/walkthroughs/56/Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_36.png)

Then, students need to right-click on the `GET` request under `Remote OS Command Injection` and click on `Open/Resend with Request Editor...`:

![Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_37.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/walkthroughs/56/Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_37.png)

The payload used for the original request prints out the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file:

![Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_38.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/walkthroughs/56/Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_38.png)

However, students need to change the payload so that it prints out the contents of the flag file "flag.txt", making sure that the whitespace is URL-encoded:

Code: shell

```shell
;cat%20/flag.txt
```

![Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_39.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/walkthroughs/56/Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_39.png)

After clicking on `Send`, students will find the flag `HTB{5c4nn3r5_f1nd_vuln5_w3_m155}` within the response:

![Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_40.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/walkthroughs/56/Using_Web_Proxies_Walkthrough_Image_40.png)
